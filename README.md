# Simple-Decision-Support-System
You are working in the production planning department of a company manufacturing luxury SUV cars for the customers in various countries. This morning, your department manager request from you to work with two new friends from the IT department to develop a simple decision support system that will be used in the forecasting processes. The software must have the following characteristics:
<br><br> The software should first request the data about last two years (24 months) from the user.
<br> Based on the data, forecasts must be made by using all the following methods:
* Exponential smoothing (𝛼=0.2)
* Double-exponential smoothing (𝛼=0.2,𝛽=0.2,𝑆0=200,𝐺0=50)
* Regression analysis
* Deseasonalized regression analysis
* MSE must be calculated for each forecasting method and the software must indicate the user that “based on the MSE comparisons, the best method for this data is …..”
* By using the best method for that data, the software must then provide the forecasts for the next two years (next 24 months).
